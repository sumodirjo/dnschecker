dnschecker
==========

DNS Checker script used to check some public DNS after we change DNS entry. This is a really simple script. You can list public DNS servers on dnslist.txt file.
If you want to separate by DNS provider put hash (#) in front of DNS provider name. and put the IP address of the DNS server below that. I already provide dnslist.txt
file. You can use this as a start but of course you can add your ISP DNS servers on this file too.

Usage : 
```
$ dnschecker <domain-to-be-checked>
```

e.g : 
```
$ dnschecker kurungsiku.com
```
